    <p>I am Stephen Hedman, one of the contributers for the project. 
        My home is in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, and I am a current 
        student of the University of St Thomas. I am majoring in Applied Mathematics 
        and will be graduating in Spring 2021. I did most of the work on getting the 
        table and map set up.

    <h1>Project details</h1>
    <p>
        The project used Nominatim for getting the geographic locations of places,
        and it used leaflet for the interactive map.

    <h1>Demo</h1>
    <p>
        You can enter a location in the search field and clicking go will
        send the map to the location if it is within the St Paul bounds.
        You can click the markers to see the number of crimes committed in each 
        neighborhood. When you move the map, the table will only show the crimes 
        committed in the neighborhoods that are still visible on the map.
